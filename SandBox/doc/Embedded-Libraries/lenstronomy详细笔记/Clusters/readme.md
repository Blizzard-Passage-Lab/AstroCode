# Lenstronomy cluster modeling

While lenstronomy originated as a modeling tool for galaxy-scale deflector lenses,
it's versatile structure allows to model galaxy clusters.

Recent implementations allows for conjugent point sources likelihoods for multiple source redshfits.
The lens model families supported by lenstronomy allow for complex and realistic mass distributions in clusters.
